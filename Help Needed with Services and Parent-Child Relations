Hello,

I am working on a Marketplace project known as hairxify.com in which I need to display Appointment functionality such as this - https://prnt.sc/WzJdJelV78Xj - on the form. But I was told by your support guy that such a feature is not available presently on the form.

Therefore, kindly help consider this in your future upgrade.

The importance of this will allow my site Seller and Service Providers such as barbers, makeup artists and Stylists to add their unlimited services to the site with the service name, cost, and duration and visitors to the site will be able to book for each of these services instantly.

See this site as well for better understanding please - https://hairxify.com/stylists/ke-unisex-salon-and-spa/

- And I want a situation where each Account user (seller) can add their unlimited single service with features such as Service Destails, cost, service duration, appointment features through their Account Page - https://prnt.sc/lNZqBo1qEnw2
